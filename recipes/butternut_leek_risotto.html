    <img src="./images/Risotto_pic.jpg" alt="Picture of finished risotto" style="width:550px;height:750px;">
    <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>This recipe can be made in as little as 30 minutes from either the Instant Pot or stove top, which makes it perfect for a perfect weekday dinner option.</p>
        <p>For additional zing, set aside the leek greens to make a leek oil garnish for a kick of umami flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced leeks (one extra large leek)</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, rough chopped</li>
            <li>8 sage leaves, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
            <li>2 heaping cups butternut squash, cubed </li>
            <li>1/4 cup white wine (optional)</li>
            <li>2 cups veggie stock or broth (or water and one teaspoon or cube veggie bouillon)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8  teaspoon white pepper (or sub black pepper to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
            <li>2–3 handfuls baby spinach or chopped kale</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: 1/2 - 1/4 cup vegan cheese or cashew cheese – or the leave cheese out and use LEEK OIL for garnish. Or stir in 1-2 tablespoons vegan butter, or a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAL: maple glazed pecans</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instant Pot Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice and rinse leeks, separating rings (rinsing will help them to soften faster).</li>
            <li>Set Instant Pot to the “Saute” function.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in the instant pot, add the rinsed leeks and stir for 2 minutes. Add garlic, sage and rice, stir for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add butternut squash, and keep stirring for a couple of minutes, until there is a bit of browning on the bottom of the instant pot.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and scrape up the browned bits-  a wooden spoon is good for this. Let all the wine cook off, about 2-3 minutes. Add the stock or broth. Scrape up more browned bits. Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg, and give a good stir.</li>
            <li>Seal the instant pot and pressure cook on HIGH for 6 minutes. Naturally, release for 5 minutes, then manually release. </li>
            <li>While the Instant pot is going you could make the leek oil and/or the maple glazed pecans.</li>
            <li>Stir the risotto, adding the spinach and vegan butter if you like, or leave them out. As the butternut breaks down a bit, it will add a nice natural creaminess to the risotto.</li>
            <li>Garnish with optional leek oil or maple glazed pecans.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Stovetop Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>ROAST BUTTERNUT: Toss the cubed butternut squash with olive oil, salt and pepper and ROAST  in a 400 F oven on a parchment-lined sheet pan until caramelized and tender 25-30 minutes. At the same time make risotto.</li>
            <li>RISOTTO: In a large heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat and add the washed leeks. Saute until fragrant and tender, covering with the lid for a few minutes to let them steam a bit. Add garlic and sage, saute 2 more minutes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the rice and saute 1 minute, stirring. Add a splash of white wine, and cook this off. Add the salt, pepper and nutmeg. Add 1-2 cups warm stock (enough to cover the rice), stir and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer until most of the liquid is absorbed.  Continue adding broth 1 cup at a time, letting the rice absorb it slowly, stirring often over med-low heat, until the rice is plumped, slightly al dente, yet creamy, about 20-25 minutes. If adding kale, add it with the last cup of broth. If adding spinach, you can stir it in at the end. Keep the risotto thick and hearty or add more stock to loosen it up a bit.</li>
            <li>Stir in the roasted butternut and spinach and vegan butter. Taste, season and adjust salt and pepper.  If bland, it probably needs more salt.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the leek oil and maple glazed pecans.</li>
        </ol>
